                <h1>Parallax</h1>
                <p>Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object due to the change in the observer's position. It is measured by the angle between two lines of sight from the observer to the object.</p>

            <p>Parallax is mathematically represented as the relationship between any two observation points and a distant object, summed up in what's known as a parallax angle. So long as some of the information is known, such as an angle between the lines of sight and the distance between observations, trigonometry can be used to deduce how far away the object is. <br>
            In <a href="../astronomy/astronomy.html">astronomy</a>, parallax is used as an irreplaceable tool for calculating distances of faraway stars. The orbit of Earth around the sun provides the baseline for these calculations. Every six months, the planet changes its position with respect to the surrounding universe by 186 million miles (300 million kilometers). Since we are making this motion together with Earth, we can observe its effect as tiny circles that stars perform in the sky every year. Due to the vast distances to even the nearest stars, these circles are barely noticeable, so detecting and measuring them is extremely difficult. <br>
            Parallax is also used in rifle scopes to ensure the reticle is accurate at any viewing angle. Parallax refers to a noticeable shift in reticle placement while looking through your scope at different angles. If you notice your reticle is moving off target while changing your viewing angle, that's parallax. You need to adjust for parallax to ensure your reticle will be accurate at any viewing angle. <br>
            Parallax design is a technique used to add a feeling of motion within a web page. It involves creating an illusion of depth using multiple layers of images moving at different speeds. Parallax design is based on the same effect as stereoscopic vision, where each of our eyes 'sees' objects according to its line of sight, with differences in the positions of objects interpreted by our brain as perpendicular distance or depth.</p>
