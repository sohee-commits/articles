                <h1>Astronomy</h1>
                <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org</a>, astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the origin and evolution of objects of interest, including planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets.</p>

            <h2>Additional text</h2>
            <p>Astronomy is different from cosmology, which is a branch of astronomy that studies the origin of the universe and how it has evolved. Cosmology is concerned with phenomena on the largest scale, such as the big bang, the origin of chemical elements, and the cosmic microwave background, while astronomy studies objects and phenomena beyond Earth. <br>
            Since the late 19th century, astronomy has expanded to include astrophysics, which is the application of physical and chemical knowledge to understand the nature of celestial objects and the physical processes that control their formation, evolution, and emission of radiation. In addition, the gases and dust particles around and between the stars have become the subjects of much research. Study of the nuclear reactions that provide the energy radiated by stars has shown how the diversity of atoms found in nature can be derived from a universe that, following the first few minutes of its existence, consisted only of hydrogen, helium, and a trace of lithium. <br>
            Astronomy is one of the oldest scientific disciplines that has evolved from the humble beginnings of counting stars and charting constellations with the naked eye to the impressive showcase of humankind's technological capabilities that we see today. There are various types of astronomy, including observational astronomy, which uses telescopes and cameras to collect data about the night sky, and theoretical astronomy, which uses that data to analyze, model, and theorize about how objects and phenomena work. There are many subsets of modern astronomy, such as astrometry, exoplanetology, planetary astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry, astrobiology, stellar astronomy, galactic astronomy, and cosmology. <br>
            Astronomy is a physical science concerned with the smallest particles and the largest natural objects. The name Astronomy comes from the Greek roots Astr- and -nomia to literally mean "name stars". Astronomy is the study of everything outside of the earth's atmosphere and their chemical and physical properties.</p>
